# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data from an API.

## Bug Description

The `MyComponent` component fetches data from a sample API endpoint.  The API call is successful, and the data is correctly stored in the component's state. However, the FlatList remains empty.  This is often due to an issue with how the data is handled or rendered within the FlatList, or timing problems within the component.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to run the app on an emulator or device. 
4. Observe that the FlatList remains empty despite successful API calls.  The console should not show any errors.

## Solution

The solution involves checking for the correct data structure and handling any potential timing issues with the state updates and renders.
